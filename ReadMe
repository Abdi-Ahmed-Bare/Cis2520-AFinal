## Assignment Overview
The purpose of this program is to manage and analyze a graph represented using an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list. It allows users to perform various graph-related operations such as displaying the graph structure, traversing the graph using different algorithms, and finding the shortest path between vertices. The program reads a graph from a file, processes it into suitable data structures, and provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the graph.
